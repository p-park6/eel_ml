# Creating a Model to Detect the Presence of Absence of Eels Species

### A repository predicting the presence or absence of eels based on other types of variables.

This repository focuses on creating a boosted tree model to predict if an eel would be present depending on the variables that would be present or absent. The project is based on the paper "A working guide to boosted regression trees" by J. Elith, J. R. Leathwick, and T. Hastie. This paper can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01390.x).
